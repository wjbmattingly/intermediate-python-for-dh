    "# How to Find Keywords in Texts Easily with Python, KeyBERT, and Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "![keybert](https://github.com/MaartenGr/KeyBERT/raw/master/images/logo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "[KeyBERT](https://github.com/MaartenGr/KeyBERT) is a minimal and efficient keyword extraction library that leverages BERT embeddings. It can be used to extract keywords from text and is particularly useful for summarizing and categorizing large datasets. Digital humanists, or anyone who works with texts, may find KeyBERT beneficial in their research for understanding key themes, characters, or ideas in textual data.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Why use KeyBERT?\n",
    "\n",
    "KeyBERT allows individuals to easily capture the keywords of a document with minimal code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "KeyBERT works by taking an input text. It then vectorizes the text with a BERT model of your choosing. Next, it compares the vector of each word in the text to the vector of the document as a whole. In doing so, KeyBERT effectively has a measure of how similar ran individual word is to the document; in other words, it knows the relevance of each word to the document as whole. Like other keyword extraction methods, this works with the presumption that the words that are most similar to the document are the keywords, or potential subjects of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation and Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using KeyBERT, you'll need to install the package. You can install it using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install keybert\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Preparing the Texts\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lesson, we'll use three random sections of the book `Dracula` by Bram Stoker."
